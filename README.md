CSC 450 Project Description

Eric and Kevin are developing a tool to identify the content of cancer related literature using machine learning.

The project uses Python to perform text mining of relavent literature and extract supplemental and descriptor terms publicly
available on PubMed.  Data from Pubtator will also be used as it already identifies terms in literature beyond the scope
available from PubMed.  Various forms of natural language processesing, such as stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, etc, 
will be performed on the data set to determine optimal efficacy of text manipulation for concept identification.

These standard and modified versions of the cancer related data will be used as a training data set.  Descriptor and supplemental 
IDs and terms identified by PubMed will be used to determine the accuracy of the machine learning throughout the iterations.
