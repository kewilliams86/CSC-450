The value of a histamine H2-receptor antagonist in the management of patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.	Inhibition of acid secretion by an H2-receptor antagonist (metiamide) was assessed in three patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Metiamide (200 or 300 mg) inhibited acid secretion transiently (2 1/2 hours) by 85 to 100 per cent in all patients. Although anticholinergic drugs alone inhibited acid secretion by only 0 to 35 per cent in these patients, the combination of metiamide and anticholinergic markedly prolonged the inhibitory effect of metiamide. Total gastrectomy was refused by one patient, and was impossible in another; both were treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for five and 10 months. A third patient was treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for three weeks in preparation for total gastrectomy. Ulcer pain and diarrhea disappeared, and each gained weight. H2-receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of some patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.	D015043
[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated medically by an inhibitor of H2 histamine receptors].	Metiamide an histamine H2-receptors antagonist has been used to treat a case of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea, an important gastric hypersecretion and a moderatly elevated plasma gastrin but without digestive ulceration. At the dose of 600 mg per day, Metiamide induced a complete suppression of acid secretion, an effect which lasted for 15 days after stopping the drug. Accordingly and since the only finding at time of laparotomy was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine metastatic tissue, the stomach was left intact and Metiamide pursued. During the first 4 months of chronic administration of Metiamide, acid secretion was maintained at levels below 25 p.cent of initial values. Ulteriorly however, although dosages of Metiamide were increased, acid hypersecretion resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed. Total gastrectomy was then performed 11 months after the beginning of Metiamide. In spite of the failure of Metiamide treatment, the long term follow up of this case of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, allowed us to get theoretical and practical informations.	D015043
Bioluminescence assay of enzymes obtained from buccal epithelium by superficial scraping.	A method is presented for the simultaneous assay of buccal enzymes by measuring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the aid of the bioluminescence of luciferase extracts. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was shown earlier to be increased in homogeneous leukoplakias of the oral mucosa. Since smoking has been implicated as an etiologic factor of leukoplakia, G6PDH was measured in the normal buccal epithelium of cigarette smokers. No difference was found in the activity of G6PDH between smokers and nonsmokers when related to the activity of pyruvate kinase, which is known to be invariable in healthy and leukoplakic oral mucosa. A new compact kinetic luminescence analyzer is briefly described.	D007972
Isolation and characterization of an unsaturated fatty acid-requiring mutant of cultured mammalian cells.	An unsaturated fatty acid-requiring mutant derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been isolated and characterized. This mutant grows normally when oleate or other unsaturated fatty acids are supplemented in the growth medium. Unlike the wild-type CHO cells, growth stops when medium is deprived of unsaturated fatty acid. Whole cell pulse experiments with [14C]acetate or [14C]stearate indicate that the mutant is defective in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Enzyme assays in vitro show that the enzymatic defect of the mutant is localized to the microsomal stearoyl-CoA desaturase.	D010051
Acid-base balance in amphibian gastric mucosa.	It has been established that H+ secretion can be maintained in frog stomach in the absence of exogenous CO2 by using a nutrient bathing fluid containing 25 mM H2PO4 (pH approximately equal to 4.5) or by lowering the pH of a nonbuffered nutrient solution to about 3.0-3.6. Exogenous CO2 in the presence of these nutrient solutions uniformly caused a marked decrease in H+ secretion, PD, adn short-circuit current (Isc) and an increase in transmucosal resistance (R). Elevation of nutrient [k+] to 83 mM reduced R significantly but transiently without change in H+ when nutrient pH less than 5.0, whereas R returned to base line and H+ increased when nutrient pH greater than 5.0. Acidification of the nutrient medium in the presence of exogenous CO2 results in inhibition of the secretory pump, probably by decreasing intracellular pH, and also interferes with conductance at the nutrient membrane. Removal of exogenous CO2 from standard bicarbonate nutrient solution reduced by 50% the H+, PD, and Isc without change in R; K+-free nutrient solutions reverse these changes in Isc and PD but not in H+. The dropping PD and rising R induced by K+-free nutrient solutions in 5% CO2 - 95% O2 are returned toward normal by 100% O2. Our findings support an important role for exogenous CO2 in maintaining normal acid-base balance in frog mucosa by acting as an acidifying agent.	D013274
Circulating levels of prolactin in human breast cancer.	Serum prolactin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassays in 98 patients with established carcinoma of breast, 12 patients with cystic mastitis and 10 patients with gynaecomastia and compared with that of age matched normal control women. The serum prolactin levels in the patients with breast cancer, gynaecomastia or cystic mastitis were observed to be similar to that in normal women. It was interesting to note that the levels of prolactin in the luteal phase of the cycle were higher than that in the early follicular phase in normal women.	D001943
An optimized semi-automatic rate method for serum glutathione reductase activity and its application to patients with malignant disease.	An improved and optimized method for serum glutathione reductase is described. The reference range for normal subjects is 47-79 IU/1. The method is more sensitive than conventional enzyme tests in the detection of malignant disease. It was not raised more frequently in patients with clinical evidence of metastases than in those clinically free of such metastases, and it did not seem to correlate with prognosis among those patients who failed to survive six months from the time the analysis was first conducted.

Cimetidine suppression of nocturnal gastric secretion in active duodenal ulcer.	Nocturnal pain and gastric hypersecretion are common in duodenal ulcer. Therefore, we investigated the antisecretory effects of a new H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, in 200-, 300- or 400-mg doses, taken orally at bedtime. The 200-mg dose did not cause a statistically significant change in nocturnal (midnight to 7 a.m.) acid output and had only a borderline effect on pH. However, the 300-mg and 400-mg doses significantly (P less than 0.001) lowered acid output and increased (P less than 0.01) intragastric pH. All doses caused substantial decreases in secretory volume output. After a 400-mg dose, half the patients remained anacidic for eight hours. Dose-related increases of drug blood levels were observed and correlated with the degree and duration of inhibition of acid output. Serum gastrin levels were unaffected. Cimetidine appears to be a potent inhibitor of nocturnal gastric secretion.	D013274
[Electronmicroscopic study of the gravity receptors in ctenophores].	Secondarily sensitive receptor balancer cells comprise the gravity receptor in the aboral organ-polivalent organ of Ctenophora. Ctenophora are phylogenetically the first animals which created receptor cell supplied with a single flagellar kinocilium connected with the otolithic apparatus. The receptor balancer cells are innervated by the nerve fiber branched off the nerve cells of the aboral ganglion. The localization of AChE, BuChE products of cytochemical reaction on sodium suggests that the cholinergic mechanism may take part in the process of synaptic transmission. Our morphological data cannot exclude an adrenergic mechanizm also.	D045888
Multiple endocrine adenomatosis syndromes.	MEA I and II are two genetically distinct tumor endocrinopathies, both showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Little overlap exists between these conditions, and that which is present can be explained on the basis of two mutually exclusive factors: (1) the secondary consequences of hormone excess on another endocrine gland or (2) the fact that both tumor syndromes appear to result from genetically faulty differentiation of neuroectoderm. A seemingly disproportionate amount of effort has been expended on study of the MEA syndromes. However, there would seen to be ample justification for this interest: 1) The MEA syndromes, unlike most neoplastic conditions, are hereditary and can be readily detected and more expeditiously treated; 2) hormone radioimmunoassay has greatly facilitated diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals; and (3) probably most importantly, study of these syndromes has provided considerable insight into the embryologic origin of the endocrine system. It is conceivable that knowledge gained from these conditions may stimulate further inquiry into the processes whereby neoplasia occurs in endocrine tissue and thus lead the way to the development of effective therapy for a host of hormone-producing tumors.

Evaluation of lipase activity in serum by radial enzyme diffusion.	Results of determination of serum lipase by radial enzyme diffusion correlate well with those by a titrimetric reference method in the abnormal range. The specificity of the diffusion assay allows the differentiation of patients with pancreatic disease, even when the lipase activity of the serum is within the normal limits of the tritrimetric assay. Pancreatic lipase is not detectable by the diffusion assay in the serum of individuals who are free from pancreatic disease.	D010190

Studies on the chemical nature of urinary chemiluminescence.	Studies on the nature of the chemicals responsible for urinary chemiluminescence have been carried out. Urinary chemiluminescence can be increased slightly by sulphatase, more by glucuronidase but most of all by boiling for 1 hour at pH 1. It is suggested that most of the chemicals responsible for urinary chemiluminescence are bound as non-chemiluminescent precursors to sulphate, glucuronic acid and in other ways. Both the chemiluminescent material and the inactive precursors are freely ultrafiltrable with molecular weights below 500. A survey of various chemicals has revealed considerable chemiluminescence in certain metabolites of naphthylamines and known to cause bladder cancer but little or no chemoluminescence in the tryptophane metabolites that have been thought to cause bladder cancer.

Suppression and stimulation mechanisms controlling glucagon secretion in a case of islet-cell tumor producing glucagon, insulin, and gastrin.	The mechanisms controlling secretion of glucagon and other pancreatic hormones were studied in a patient affected with multihormone-secreting islet-cell tumor. Fasting glucagon levels (3,000 pg./ml.) rose to 10 ng./ml. following arginine stimulation. While oral glucose load and intravenous glucose infusion did not suppress glucagon secretion, insulin administration induced a prompt depression in glucagon levels. Glucagon, insulin, and gastrin levels were suppressed by somatostatin while calcium infusion caused a paradoxical increase. It is suggested that only some of the stimulation-inhibition mechanisms were conserved in this case of glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor.	D010190
Studies of human transcortin at different pHs: circular dichroism, polymerisation and binding affinity.	The transcortin we have used in this work is extremely pure. This was shown by the polymerisation observed at pH 4. This polymerisation is never observed with an impure form of transcortin [4]. Moreover, since it is known that the presence of cortisol in the binding site is an essential condition to the activity of purified transcortin [5], it appears that a correlation between the secondary structure and the biological activity of the transcortin exists. The results we have obtained are summarized below: (1) The inhibition of the transcortin binding capacity essentially takes place between pH 5 and 4. (2) A reorganisation of the structure of the protein moiety is observed between pH 6.5 and 5.9. (3) A decrease of the helicity ratio is observed between pH 5 and 4. It appears therefore that, in the limits of experimental accuracy of CD measurements to determine the amount of beta-structure, no appreciable change of binding activity is taking place after the appearance of a large percentage of beta-structure between pH 6.5 and 6. On the other hand, the sudden decrease of protein activity at low pH is likely to be correlated with the disappearance of a well-defined helical region. Other biochemical and physical experiments would be of course necessary, in order to precise this first observation of a structure-function relationship in transcortin.	D006223
Synthetic MIF has no effect on beta-MSH and ACTH hypersecretion in Nelson's syndrome.	The effect of synthetic MIF (H-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) on beta-MSH secretion was studied in five patients with Nelson's syndrome and in one patient with Addison's disease. Two milligrams of the tripetide were injected intravenously (1 mg in an acute injection, followed by a 30-minute-infusion of 1 mg in 20 ml of saline solution). No consistent effect could be observed during the 90-minute period after the beginning of the infusion. In the same patients, LVP stimulation and dexamethasone suppression tests brought about significant changes in the plasma beta-MSH and ACTH levels.	D049913
Histamine metabolism. I. Thin-layer radiochromatographic assays for histaminase and histidine decarboxylase enzyme activities.	Thin-layer radiochromatographic methods for the measurement of histaminase and histidine decarboxylase activities have been developed. The assays are specific for the respective enzymes, are sensitive and reproducible, and can be performed using commercially available substrates. The histaminase assay permits determination of enzyme activity from 2.5 mul of pregnancy sera, 1-2 X 10(6) human granulocytes, and microgram quantities of partially purified human placenta histaminase with an error of less than 5 per cent. The histidine decarboxylase assay permits measurement of nanogram quantities of newly formed histamine from as few as 2 X 10(4) rat peritoneal mast cells or rat basophilic leukemia cells with an error of less than 5 per cent.

Isolation, by partial pepsin digestion, of the three collagen-like regions present in subcomponent Clq of the first component of human complement.	1. Digestion of human subcomponent C1q with pepsin at pH4.45 for 20h at 37 degrees C fragmented most of the non-collagen-like amino acid sequences in the molecule to small peptides, whereas the entire regions of collagen-like sequence that comprised 38% by weight of the subcomponent C1q were left intact. 2. The collagen-like fraction of the digest was eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-200 column, was was showm to be composed of two major fragments when examined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels run in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulphate. These fragments were separated on CM-cellulose at pH4.9 in buffers containing 7.5M-urea. 3. Human subcomponent C1q on reduction and alkylation yields equimolar amounnts of three chains, which have been designated A, B and C [Reid et al. (1972) Biochem. J. 130, 749-763]. One of the pepsin fragments was shown to be composed of the N-terminal 95 residues of the A chain linked, via residue A4, by a single disulphide bond to a residue in the sequence B2-B6 in the N-terminal 91 residues of the B chain. The second pepsin fragment was shown to be composed of a disulphide-linked dimer of the N-terminal 94 residues of the C chain, the only disulphide bond being located at residue C4.4. The mol. wts. of the unoxidized and oxidized pepsin fragments were estimated from their amino acid compositions to be 20 000 and 18 200 for the A-B and C-C dimers and 11 400, 8800 and 9600 for the collagen-like fragments of the A, B and C chains respectively. Estimation of the molecular weights of the peptic fragments by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate gave values that were approx. 50% higher than expected from the amino acid sequence data. This is probably due to the high collagen-like sequence content of these fragments.	D018365
Amino acid transport in isolated neurons and glia.	Our efforts have been directed towards characterizing amino acid uptake, metabolism and release in bulk-isolated glia and neuronal perikarya studied in parallel with nerve-endings, especially as it concerns the transmitter amino acids and the participation of glia in the clearing of the synpatic space during impulse conduction. A possible neuromodulator role for the glia at the synapse is also suggested by K+-stimulated release. Our most definitive conclusions have been based so far on studies with GABA, although we are also beginning to accumulate data for glutamate related to glutamate-glutamine compartmentation. Glia preferentially accumulate potassium and amino acids compared to neuronal perikarya, have higher Na+/K+-ATPase activity, possess high-affinity, sodium-dependent uptake systems for GABA and glutamate similar to the ones in synaptosomes, and release amino acid in response to a potassium pulse by a calcium-independent process. Low neuronal uptake could be due to loss of dendrites. Unidirectional GABA-flux from the synaptosomal to glial compartment is supported by high GAD in nerve endings compared to high GABA-T in glia. Glutamine may be a transmitter glutamate-precursor in nerve-endings since glutaminase activity is high in nerve-endings, but low in glia where glutamine is presumably made. Glutamine uptake in both glia and synaptosomes obeys low-affinity kinetics in contrast to glutamate, consistent with the inability of glutamine to excite the neuronal membrane. The studies with GABA, which are considerably more extensive, are supported by related work using glia in tissue-culture and autoradiography. There appears to be a suggested difference in the behavior of amines which were poorly taken up by the glial system. Glia, synaptosomes and neuronal perikarya, in general behaved similarly with respect to requirements for uptake and release, except in the case of Ca++, which exerted opposite effects on glial and synaptosomal uptake of GABA. We believe that work along these lines tends to firmly establish a direct role for glial cells as modulators of neuronal excitability and represents a convergence between transmitter amino acid neuropharmacology and cellular biochemistry. This not only deepens and enlarges the vocabulary of synaptic biochemistry but also undoubtedly will have major clinical applications in the fields of epilepsy and behavior.	D015458
Gastric and extragastric gastrin release in normal subjects in duodenal ulcer patients, and in patients with partial gastrectomy (Billroth I).	In 10 normal subjects, in 32 patients with duodenal ulcer (DU), and in 11 patients with partial gastrectomy (Billroth I), serum gastrin rose significantly after an oral and intraduodenal test meal. The highest increases were observed in DU patients after the oral as well as after the intraduodenal test meal. After the intraduodenal test meal in 4 normal subjects and in 17 DU patients an increase of gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin was measured. In basal state, after an intraduodenal or an oral test meal, DU patients with normal gastric acid secretory capacity had higher serum gastrin concentrations than DU patients with gastric hypersecretion. There was a good correlation between peak serum gastrin levels after the oral and after the intraduodenal test meal. From these data it is concluded: (1) Intraduodenal application of a test meal results in release of gastrin from extragastric sites. (2) Extragastric gastrin is biologically active. (3) DU patients are able to release more antral and more extragastric gastrin in response to a test meal. Further studies, however, are necessary to show the significance of these findings in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease.	D013274

[Statistical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid acid-base equilibrium and cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration in cases of brain tumors, cerebrocranial injuries and meningoencephalitis].	A statistical analysis of CSF lactate concentration and CSF pH and PCO2 was performed. The values were obtained from 211 samples taken from 76 neurosurgical patients. The values of pH and pCO2 were classified in three groups corresponding to the following three ranges of lactate concentration: below 15 mg%, 15-30 mg%, over 30 mg%. The mean values and standard deviations were calculated: suitable tests: F, t (Student), C (Cochran and Cox) were used. It was established, that statistically significant changes of CSF acid-base balance were present at lactate levels over 30 mg%. Next, the patients with lactate concentrations over 30 mg% were analysed. They were divided into three groups according to etiology: inflammatory changes, injuries, tumours. It was shown, that the CSF acid-base balance in patients with brain tumours is less disturbed then in patients with inflammatory changes or brain injury.	D001932
Influence of acid secretory state on the gastric mucosal tolerance to back diffusion of H+.	The effect of back diffusion of H+ PON THE POTENTIAL DIFFERence (PD), electrical resistance (R), and short circuit current (Isc) of spontaneously secreting and burimamide-inhibited amphibian gastric mucosae were studied in vitro. When back diffusion of H+ was induced by the passage of an electrical current of 510 mua per cm2 from the secretory (S) side of pH 2.25 to the nutrient side (N) for 30 min, the spontaneously secreting mucosae showed small decreases in PD (23.6 leads to 16.2 mv) and Isc (80 leads to 61 mua per cm2) but no significant change in R. In the burimamide-inhibited mucosae there were marked and significantly greater decreases of PD (26.8 leads to 3.4 mv), R (473 leads to 170 ohms cm2) and Isc (50 leads to 13 mua per cm2). When back diffusion of H+ was induced by establishing a concentration gradient of H+ from S leads to N or by exposing the secretory surface to sodium taurocholate with secretory pH 2.25, the burimamide-inhibited tissue demonstrated significantly greater depression of the electrical parameters than the secreting mucosae. Intracellular pH, measured by the 5,5-dimethoxyazolidine-2,4-dione method, was significantly higher in the histamine-stimulated tissues (7.28) than in the metiamide-inhibited tissues (7.11). These studies strongly suggest that the secretory status of the mucosa and hence its acid-base status are important determinants in the tolerance of the tissue to exogenous back diffusion of H+. The measure of absolute loss of H+ From the mucosal solution alone may not be an adequate assessment of the gastric mucosal barrier.	D013274
Interaction of tropomyosin with troponin components.	1. The TN-T and TN-I components of troponin both interact with tropomyosin and cause its precipitation in 0.1 M KC1 at neutral pH. The precipitate contains both end-to-end and side-by-side aggregates of tropomyosin molecules. 2. The TN-T and TN-I components change the band pattern of tropomyosin paracrystals formed in MgC1(2) solutions, although in different ways. TN-T causes the formation of hexagonal net structures, double-stranded net or paracrystals which result from the collapse of the double-stranded net. TN-I at pH 7.9 causes the formation of paracrystals with a 400 A periodic band pattern and a 200 A repeat. The same band pattern can also be seen in tropomyosin paracrystals formed at pH values below 6.0. 3. The TN-C component does not precipitate tropomyosin in 0.1 M KC1. The aggregates of tropomyosin obtained with either TN-T or TN-I can be solubilized by the addition of TN-C. No interaction of TN-C was observed with tropomyosin paracrystals formed in the presence of MgC12.	D015458
[Critical observations on changes in gamma-glutamyl-transpepdidase in hepatopathies].	The behaviour of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was compared with other serum enzyme activities and functional parameters in a carefully selected and relatively extensive series of patients with liver disease, including alcoholics, in an investigation of the underlying pathogenesis and its clinical expression. Reference. to the literature and to personal data showed that increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels could be attributed to enzyme induction (caused by drugs or alcohol), liver damage in the broad sense, and intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. These causes were individually predominant, or nearly so, on occasions, though their concomitance was more common. High levels, however, were not pathognomonic for a given disease. In alcoholism, they were highly indicative, especially if accompanied by GLD changes. They were a virtually constant, early, and typical finding in intra- and extra-hepatic cholestasis, and tended to persist for a time after the resolution of icterus. Lastly, they were an aid in the early diagnosis of aggressive hepatitis and liver cancer.	D008113
Polynucleotides. XL. Synthesis and properties of poly 2'-azido-2'-deoxyadenylic acid.	Poly 2'-azido-2'-deoxyadenylic acid (Poly Az) was synthesized from 2'-azido-2'-deoxyadenosine diphosphate by polynucleotide phosphorylase. Poly (Az) has U.V. absorption properties similar to poly (A) and hypochromicity of 40% at 0.1 M Na+ and neutrality. CD curve also resembled to that of poly (A), but has smaller ellipticity. Titration of poly (Az) with HCl gave a transition at pH 5.5, but exact structure of the acid-form complex was not elucidated. Upon mixing with poly (U), poly (Az) forms a 1:1 and 1:2 complexes having Tm's somewhat higher than that of poly (A)- poly (U) complex in the same condition.	D006223
Disorders induced by pheochromocytoma in the cardiovascular system. A therapeutic approach.	The diagnosis of pheochromocytoms is still made only post mortem in a high percentage of the cases. It is important to know both the diversity of clinical forms (of the 16 cases investigated 13 (80%) presented permanent AH, of which 12 cases with paroxysmal attacks, followed by collapse only in one case, and 3 (20%) with paroxysmal AH on a normotensive background) and the severity of cardiovascular accidents, which increases twofold during crises (arrhythmias, left ventricular failure, coronary insufficiency, cerebrovascular strokes, secondary adrenalinic shocks). These complications are preceded by the "alarm syndrome". The preoperatory treatment is associated: blocking of adrenergic alpha-receptors and beta-receptors; correction of hypovolemia, also applied during the surgical phase I (until the venous ligature is made and the tumor excised) under continuous monitoring (ECG, ABP and central venous pressure). In phase II vasoplegin should be promptly corrected by nor. E+E, and corticoids.	D018358
[Sialyltransferase in human malignant melanoma].	A glycosyltransferase, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid : glycoprotein sialyltransferase was found in human malignant melanoma.

The enzyme was characterized by means of its pH optimum, 5.5, temperature optimum, 30 degrees C, KM values, 10 muM for the sugar nucleotide and 0.3 mM for desialized glycoprotein. It did not require exogenously added metal ions but was slightly stimulated by Mg2+. It required detergent for optimal activity.

beta-Glucuronidase and oestrogens in hydatidiform mole.	The activity of beta-glucuronidase (beta-D-glucuronide glycuronohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31) in placental and hydatidiform mole tissue and in sera from non-pregnant, normal and molar pregnant women was determined. The oestrogen concentrations in the two solid tissues were also assayed. Significant differences were found in the activities of the enzyme between placental and molar tissues and among the various sera. The lower activity in molar serum corresponds to a lower concentration of oestrogens in molar tissues and may be regarded as a response to the alleviation of conjugation requirements.	D006828
Histamine H2-receptor antagonists and gastric acid secretion -- a progress report.	Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, including burimamide, metiamide and cimetidine, are effective antagonists of histamine-stimulated acid secretion from mammalian, avian or reptilian gastric mucosa. Acid secretion stimulated by gastrin or pentagastrin is also inhibited by these drugs, but there is disagreement about the effects of these drugs on acid secretion resulting from activation of acetylcholine receptors. Based on the pharmacological evidence possibilities of treatment by these drugs were discussed in cases with excessive stimulation of acid secretion due to high blood levels of histamine or gastrin. The positive results in several trials on Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and peptic ulcer were very impressive. Some practical problems have still to be solved, for example the appropriate phase for applying the drugs. The demonstrated clinical effectiveness, however, against peptic ulceration offers a clear alternative to surgery for many patients.	D015043
Gingival crevicular fluid: a new diagnostic aid in managing the periodontal patient.	On the whole, the studies on GCF have demonstrated that the flow of this fluid is sufficiently indicative of the inflammatory state that it can be used under a variety of clinical conditions to monitor and control gingival inflammation. Since gingivitis is extremely common, and since some cases of gingivitis presumably do not progress to periodontitis, the question could be posed whether or not a concerted effort to control inflammation (i.e. trying to achieve a GCF flow as near to zero as possible) would be clinically significant. Until there is evidence to the contrary, the answer must be "yes", since few cases are known where periodontitis occurs without being preceded by gingivitis. In other words, the control of all gingivitis, if feasible, should prevent most cases of periodontitis. Although control of all gingivitis would mean the treatment of many cases that would not progress to periodontal breakdown, such efforts would be worth-while if most periodontal destruction were prevented. Even the early destructive lesion exhibiting little or no inflammation may soon be identified, mainly because the minute volume of fluid collected from the gingival crevice can now be measured accurately. Accordingly, the concentration of various constituents in the GCF can be determined, which should lead to the development of tests to differentiate between pockets undergoing active destruction with minimal inflammation from the majority of active lesions that are intimately involved with frank inflammation. Thus, a clinician would measure sub-clinical gingival inflammation by measuring GCF flow, then differentiate destructive from quiescent lesions by analyzing the GCF sample for some constituent(s), chemical or microbial (Listgarten et al. 1975) indicative of the periodontal destructive process. Monitoring the flow of GCF might be of value in other clinical situations. For example, one could monitor the response of gingival tissues to various restorative and prosthetic procedures (Strauss et al. 1975) to ensure that these procedures do not aggravate the periodontal tissues and induce gingivitis or periodontitis. The education of the patient should be easier since patients can read their own numbers on the GCF meter at each examination and self-evaluate their personal periodontal condition and the effectiveness of their home care. Even the education of the dental student should be easier since he or she would have the means of self-evaluating the effectiveness of treatment, and not be as dependent upon the subjective assessment of his efforts by an instructor. Finally, monitoring GCF for various components could provide the dentist with a valuable means of easily screening patients for systemic disease. Obviously, this area of investigation is in its infancy, but does promise an exciting future for the oral diagnostician.	D008415
Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 16alpha-hydroxylase in cultured human lymphocytes.	Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 16alpha-hydroxylase were examined in intact, cultured human lymphocytes. The two microsomal mixed-function oxygenases had different pH optima and showed competitive inhibition for enzyme induction and activity. Population distributions were lognormal for both enzymes, giving apparent evidence for polygenic control. Induced levels of AHH were slightly higher among first-order relatives of lung or colon cancer patients than in the control group. The correlation coefficient (r) for AHH and SAH coinducibility was -0.08, indicating no correlation and suggesting the absence of association between the two enzymes in man.	D007414
The relationship of the serum gastrin and calcium concentrations in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I.	The relationship between the serum gastrin and calcium concentrations has been examined in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. Variations in gastrin concentrations were induced by metiamide and secretin; calcium concentrations were altered by parathyroidectomy and by calcium infusion. Changes in the serum gastrin concentrations were not accompanied by changes in the serum calcium concentration. However, alteration of the serum calcium was accompanied by significant parallel changes in the serum gastrin. It is concluded that acute changes in the serum calcium may induce changes in the serum gastrin. Parathyroidectomy in these patients produced a fall in the serum gastrin, but the ability to produce large quantities of gastrin remains. It is postulated that the thyro-parathyroid hormones may modulate the relationship between calcium and gastrin.	D018761

Recent studies on the identification of proliferative abnormalities and of oncogenic potential of cutaneous cells in individuals at increased risk of colon cancer.	This recent study describes the growth characteristics of ACR skin fibroblasts in culture and their differential susceptibility to transformation by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV). The SF were derived from normal appearing subepidermoid biopsies of ACR individuals, their progeny and ocntrols. Normal SF were contact-inhibited and grew only in 15% FCS. SF of ACR subjects, and some asymptomatic ACR progeny were not contact inhibited, grew in both 1% and 15% FCS and were considerably more susceptible to transformation by Ki-MSV than were control SF. The virally transformed SF showed a loss of anchorage dependency in methylcellulose and formed tumors in athymic mice. The results suggest the presence of early and previously undetected metabolic lesions in SF from clinically asymptomatic subjects. These phenotype markers are currently evaluated for their utility in the clinical diagnosis of individuals with latent ACR and those at increased risk for colon cancer. SF from ACR individuals have been recently shown to contain significant alterations in the intracellular distribution of actin (R. Pollack and L. Kopelovich, in preparation), and elevated levels of plasminogen activator (L. Kopelovich).	D007414
The mechanism of reassembly of immunoglobulin G.	The noncovalent interaction of light (L) chain with heavy (H) chain or Fd isolated from a human myeloma protein Jo (IgG1, kappa) was studied by following circular dichroic (CD) change at 235 nm. The dimerization constants of Jo-L chain determined by measuring the CD change at 293 nm with protein concentration showed that the Jo-L chain exists as the monomeric form under the experimental conditions used for recombination with H chain. The second-order rate constants for the interaction between H and L chains were in good agreement with those for the interaction between Fd and L chain at various pH values. The binding behavior of L chain to Fd could be described by a single association constant. In the interpretation of the binding of L chain to H chain, however, it was necessary to assume that the binding of L chain to one of the two sites on H chain dimer (H2) decreases the affinity of the other site for L chain. The binding constant of the first L chain to H2 was the same as that of L chain to Fd. Renaturation processes of L chain, Fd, Fab(SS) fragment (with intact interchain disulfide bond), and Fab(RA) fragment (in which the interchain disulfide bond had been reduced and alkylated) from the denatured states in 0.5 or 1 M acetic acid on neutralization were studied. The renaturation of Fd occurred very rapidly, while that of L chain consisted of a very rapid process and a slow process which followed first-order kinetics. The renaturation process of Fab(SS) consisted of rapid and slow phases, of which the latter followed first-order kinetics. The renaturation process of Fab(RA) also consisted of rapid and slow phases, but the latter process followed second-order kinetics. The overall rate constant of renaturation of Fab(RA) was the same as that of the reformation of Fab(RA) from isolated Fd and L chain. On the basis of these facts, the kinetic mechanism by which Fd and L chain recombine to yield Fab(RA) can be described in terms of the scheme Fd + L in equilibrium Fd ... L leads to Fab(RA), where Fd ... L is an intermediate, and CD change is only observed in the second unimolecular process and not in the first bimolecular process.	D009101
A study of the interaction between D-amino acid oxidase and quasi-substrates.	To study the interaction between D-amino acid oxidase [EC 1.4.3.3] and quasi-substrates such as benzoate and o-, m-, and p-aminobenzoate, visible circular dichroism spectra (CD spectra) were measured and the binding rate and affinity of o-aminobenzoate to the enzyme were observed by following the absorption changes at various wavelengths. We found a new CD band around 560 nm, corresponding to the charge-transfer complexes which result from the formation of aminobenzoate complexes with the enzyme. The ellipticity of this band was positive for the p-aminobenzoate complex, but negative for the o- and m-aminobenzoate complexes. Crossover points in CD spectra were observed at 470 nm for the m-aminobenzoate complex and at 475 nm for the o-aminobenzoate complex. They probably resulted from overlapping of the positive CD band of FAD bound with the enzyme and the negative CD band of the charge-transfer complex. We propose that the amino group in aminobenzoate, not the pi-electrons of the benzene ring, is the electron donor in the charge-transfer complex and that the position of the amino group is very important for the charge-transfer interaction. The binding rate and affinity of o-aminobenzoate to the enzyme were determined using the absorption changes at 370 nm (380 nm), caused by the modification of electronic states of FAD bound with the enzyme, and at 550 nm (565 nm), caused by the formation of the charge-transfer complex of o-aminobenzoate with the enzyme. No differences between these parameters with wavelength were observed. This independence of wavelength simplifies discussion of the experimental data obtained from absorption changes.	D006223
Acetylcholine synthesis in sympathetic human neuroblastoma.	The synthesis of acetylcholine, as well as catecholamines, was studied by assaying the activities of choline acetyltransferase (ChA) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the tumor tissues and the culture cells of human neuroblastoma. In the majority of 20 neuroblastomas of sympathetic origin, both ChA and TH activities were detected at a significantly high level. In the culture cells of five cell lines of human neuroblastoma, ChA activity was high, but TH was negative in four of the lines. However, it was observed that these enzyme activities changed significantly while in the long-term culture. ChA assay is a useful diagnostic test for neuroblastomas that synthesize acetylcholine. Future studies of neuroblastoma should consider cholinergic activity.	D018302
Investigations of the mechanism of central action of kinins.	The effects of kinins on the level of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin and on their metabolites, i.e., normetanephrine, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoloacetic acid in the brain tissue divided into cerebellum, corpus striatum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and midbrain were investigated. It was shown that bradykinin in a dose of 4 mug decreased the content of norepinephrine in corpus striatum, midbrain, and cerebellum. It also decreased the level of dopamine in corpus striatum but increased the level of serotonin in corpus striatum and midbrain. Similar changes were observed with 100 Mu/kg of kallikrein. It was that changed levels of investigated neuromediators are accompanied by changed levels of their metabolites. Bradykinin, in a dose of 4 mug, decreased the level of normetanephrine in corpus striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain and the level of homovanillic acid in corpus striatum, and increased the level of 5-hydroxyindoloacetic acid in corpus striatum and hippocampus. It was also shown that bradykinin increased norepinephrine uptake by the blood platelets when its level in the platelets was low, and released the absorbed norepinephrine into the medium when the level of norepinephrine was higher. The above results confirm the existence of an interaction of kinins with neuromediators in the central nervous system.	D001932
[New findings on human prolactin].	Since prolactin (HPRL) occurs as a separate pituitary hormone in man the paper will discuss results about the mechanisms involved regulation of HPRL secretion. A number of factors which lead to an increase in HPRL secretion are named. The clinical relevance of HPRL inhibiting substances as L-DOPA and 2-Br-alpha-ergocryptine is mentioned. The influence of HPRL in pregnancy and lactation period is described also the regulative effect of HPRL on hormone-dependent breast tumors.	D001943
Experience with incompatible maternal donors for bone marrow transplantation.	Marrow transplantation in aplastic anemia and leukemia has generally been limited to siblings who have been histocompatible at both the serological (A and B) and lymphocyte determined (D or MLC) loci of the HLA system. We studied three male patients, two with aplastic anemia and one with acute myelogenous leukemia, who received transplants from their histoincompatible mothers. MLC studies between donors and recipients showed varying degrees of stimulation. Definite engraftment occurred in one patient and transient engraftment in another. Engraftment in the third patient could not be evaluated. In the patient with sustained engraftment, there was clinical evidence of severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) however, this was not substantiated by histologic findings. This preliminary study suggests that MLC incompatibility may be more of an indicator of the risk of GVHD than of bone marrow rejection. If more effective control of GVHD can be accomplished, marrow transplantation between MLC-reactive individuals may become feasible.	D015470
N-Acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity in hydatidiform mole.	The N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity in hydatidiform mole is two-fold higher than that in full-term placenta. Qualitatively, the enzymes from the two tissues are similar with respect to KM values and pH optima. Both enzymes also contain a new isoenzyme form detectable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the molar enzyme is more susceptible to heat denaturation, presumably due to the presence of a higher level of the heat-labile isoenzyme form A in this tissue. Data are also presented incicating that the placenta is not the source of the N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity in maternal serum.	D006828
Hormone production in ovarian carcinomas. Histochemical approach in stroma reaction.	Enzymatically active stromal cells (EASC) in different ovarian tumors are concerned with hormon production. 198 cases of ovarian tumors were investigated by different histochemical methods. Distribution of lactate-and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase was investigated by plaimetric measurement.--EASC were found in benign ovarian tumors in 48%, in malignant in 30%. They are found exclusively in ovarian tumors and are completely absent in metastases. Incidence is dependent on histological type of tumor. With regard to untreated ovarian carcinoma containing EASC, these cells cover an aerea of 1.9% (0.5-5.9%). EASC occur in a very high percentage after menopause and are reduced by chemotherapy or radioation. Incidence of EASC in ovarian tumors is in relation with postmenopausal bleeding. Glandular-cystic endometrium is noticed only in connection with EASC. There is a positive relation between the quantity of EASC and the incidence of bleeding.--EASC are characterized by a strong NADP-dependent-dehydrogenase-reaction and reactions for lactate-, malate-dehydrogenases and alcaline phosphatases. Apart from that these cells are not all uniform. It seems that the enzymatically active fibrocytes are the first step of theca-like cells which are then luteinized and finally filled up with cholesterol. Histochemistry of EASC in comparison with other steroid-producing tissues make possible, that these cells have an estrogenic and more seldomly also an androgenic activity.	D010051

Monoamine metabolism in human brain.	Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels were measured in human brain tissue obtained at autopsy from a series of 39 patients dying of various medical and accidental causes. The nine following brain areas were studied: globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, floor of the fourth ventricle, orbital cortex, caudate nucleus, and mammillary bodies. Enzyme activity correlated positively with age in all brain areas for MAO (with both benzylamine and tryptamine substrates) but no consistent pattern of correlation was found for COMT and TH. Mean MAO activity was significantly higher in women than men. There is increased brain MAO activity during late childhood and adolescence. These data are consistent with previous evidence suggesting that age and sex are important determinants of amine metabolism in the human central nervous system.	D001932
Acute-phase reactant protein profiles: an aid to monitoring large bowel cancer by CEA and serum enzymes.	The profiles of 4 acute-phase reactant proteins (APRPs) (haptoglobin (HPT), alpha1 antitrypsin (AAT), alpha1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and prealbumin (PALB)) have been studied during the evolution of bowel cancer. Serial measurements of these APRPs can add to the information obtained from measurements of the level of CEA and hepatic enzymes during the monitoring of postoperative patients. There is considerable stability in the profile in a given individual in health, Rises of AAT and AGP are associated with metastases. High levels of HPT may suggest involvement of the bowel wall by recurrent cancer. PALB levels tend to reflect the nutritional status. A discriminant function based on the log CEA, AAT and AGP preoperative blood levels can considerably improve on the predictive value attained using CEA levels alone.	D009362
beta-Hexosaminidase isozymes in human colonic carcinoma.	Isoelectric focusing of crude extracts demonstrated that human colonic carcinomas contained a higher proportion of beta-hexosaminidase B than beta-hexosaminidase A, while normal human colonic mucosa contained a higher proportion of the A form of the enzyme. Studies of the isolated isozymes showed that beta-hexosaminidase B was more stable to heat and more active at low pH than beta-hexosaminidase A. Kinetic studies revealed that the A and B forms of beta-hexosaminidase had essentially the same Km and Vmax for p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide.	D007414
Comparison of the in vitro conversion of estradiol-17 beta to estrone of normal and neoplastic human breast tissue.	Specific activity  of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) was measured in 48 tissue specimens of human female breast cancer and, in addition, 48 nonmalignant tissue specimens obtained in each case from the same cancer-bearing breast. In all cases the nonmalignant tissue showed greater conversion of estradiol-17 beta into estrone than the neoplastic tissues. In normal human breast tissue of premenopausal women specific enzyme activity depended on the phase of the MENSTRUAL CYCLE: the highest values of 17 beta-HSD activity were found in the early secretory phase. To determine the intracellular distribution of the 17 beta-HSD, purified microsomes, mitochondria, peroxysomes, lysosomes, nuclei and cytosol fractions were prepared. The purity of each fraction was monitored by marker enzymes. It was found that the 17 beta-HSD was mainly located in mitochondria and microsomes. Furthermore it could be demonstrated that the microsomal enzyme was bound tightly to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, while the mitochondrial 17 beta-HSD was mainly associated with the outer membranes of the organelle. Kinetic parameters (Km-values, coenzyme requirements and maximal velocities) of a cytoplasmic, nuclear, mitochondrial and microsomal 17 beta-HSD of normal and neoplastic human mammary tissue were compared. Maximal velocity was highest in enzyme preparations of normal mammary tissue obtained from premenopausal women in the early secretory phase. Km-values wrere nearly identical in normal and neoplastic mammary tissue preparations (approx. 1 X 10(-6) M). NAD was more efficient than NADP as a cofactor. For the conversion of estradiol to estrone the optimum temperature was approximately 40 degrees C and the optimum pH 9.5. For the reduction of estrone the optimum pH was 6.5. Sulphydryl groups were shown to be essential for catalysis.	D001943

Renin and aldosterone secretion in pheochromocytoma. Effect of chronic alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade.	Patients suffering from pheochromocytoma characterized by an exclusive or almost exclusive excess of norepinephrine showed no (one patient) or only a moderate increase (two patients) in renin and aldosterone secretion. In those three patients with concomitant distinct hypersecretion of epinephrine, renin release (and aldosterone secretion except in one patient) was markedly enhanced. Similar results were obtained in a patient with excess norepinephrine and dopamine secretion. Renin release was markedly reduced in all patients during preoperative long-term alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. With the exception of one patient, increased renin and aldosterone secretion was abolished. The results indicate that augmentation in renin release depends on the ratio of the different catecholamines secreted by the pheochromocytoma and their different effe-tiveness in stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors. Even in the presence of excess catecholamine secretion, there is evidence that renin secretion is predominantly mediated by beta receptors rather than by renal vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors. Normalization of catecholamine-induced enhanced renin release in patients with pheochromocytoma during chronic alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade supports the assumption that (alpha-) adrenergic blocking agents inhibit renin secretion distal to their blockade of specific adrenergic receptors. However, contrary to beta-adrenergic blockade, circadian rhythm of renin release seems to remain intact during alpha-adrenergic blockade.	D018358
Inhibitors of L-asparagine synthetase, in vitro.	A systematic search has been made for inhibitors of L-asparagine synthetase (L-glutamine hydrolyzing, EC 6.3.5.4) from leukemia 5178Y/AR, a rodent neoplasm resistant to the oncolytic enzyme L-asparaginase (EC 3.5.1.1), The classes of chemicals examined in this search included substrate and product analogs, agents capable of reacting with sulfhydryl functions, and a variety of modifiers whose mechanism of interaction with proteins is known. In general, antagonists of L-glutamine and thiol reagents proved to be the most effective inhibitors of L-asparagine synthetase from this tumor source. Within these groups, certain structural prerequisites to inhibition are reported. Attempts to correlate oncolytic potency with enzyme-inhibitory potency were unsuccesful.	D007938
The activity and distribution of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GT) in human foetal organs.	The activity and distribution of y-GT was investigated in a number of organs from human foetuses aged from 14 to 24 weeks post menstruationem. Over this period, enzyme activity increased in the kidney, pancreas and thymus, but decreased in the small intestine. No trend could be established for the liver, although activity was high. In the lung, spleen, brain and adrenals, y-GT was either detectable at very low levels or could not be demonstrated. The possible relationship between y-GT activity in some human tumours and the enzyme level in the corresponding foetal organs is discussed.	D010190
Effects of acetylsalicylate on alkalinization, acid secretion and electrogenic properties in the isolated gastric mucosa.	The effects of acetylsalicylate (ASA) on the in vitro secretory and electrical properties of Necturus and Rana temporaria gastric mucosa have been studied. The gastric antrum alkalinized the luminal surface, while in the fundus it is likely that acidificaiton and alkalinization occur simultaneously and that net secretion is due to the dominance of one or other of these processes. The histamine H2  receptor antagonist Metiamide was used to inhibit acid secretion for studies on fundic alkalinization in Rana temporaria. Submucosal application of 3 mM ASA for 30 min markedly reduced alkalinization in the antrum and the frog fundus. Following removal of ASA there was only partial recovery of this secretion. The drug caused slight inhibtion of spontaneous acid secretion in Necturus fundus but not of histamine-stimulated acid secretion in the frog fundus. Following salicylate removal, the rate of acid secretion increased to a higher level than before administration in both tissues. There was a small flux of ASA across the mucosa which was greatest in the acid secreting frog fundus (4.38mumol cm-2 min-1) and least in the antrum (2.19 mumol cm-2 min-1). Esposure of the gastric mucosa to ASA was generally associated with a fall in transmucosal electric potential difference and short-circuit current together with an increase in electrical resistance. It is proposed that the greater sensitivity of alkalinization to ASA is responsible for the apparent increase in the rate of acid secretion which occured.	D013274
Localization of hypophysiotropic neurohormones by assay of sections from various brain areas.	The results of studies of the localization of the hypothalamic hypophysiotropic factors based on their direct determination in sections or nuclear punches are described. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone was found in high concentrations in the median eminence-arcuate nucleus complex, in lower concentrations in the mediobasal zone of the preoptic area. In addition to these hypothalamic sites, it is present in all four periventricular organs, especially in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis. Thyrotropin releasing hormone has a widespread distribution. High concentrations are in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, and anterior part of the ventromedial nucleus. Lower concentrations are in several other structures of the hypothalamus, preoptic area and septum, and low but measurable quantities are found in most of the structures of the brain. Somatostatin is also present in most structures of the central nervous system, with highest concentrations in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, ventromedial nucleus and periventricular nucleus. There are indications that the ventromedial nucleus or its immediate vicinity contains growth hormone releasing factor. Prolactin releasing activity was present in the median eminence and mediobasal parts of the anterior hypothalamus, whereas prolactin inhibitory activity was in the dorsolateral parts of the anterior hypothalamus and/or preoptic area.

[Diagnosis of hepatic metastasis by enzymatic assay. Value of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase].	Variations in serum enzyme levels were studied in 50 patients suffering from various types of neoplasm, 25 of whom had hepatic metastases. In the absence of any associated hepato-biliary or pancreatic disorder, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase would appear to be a reliable test in 96 % of cases. It represents a factor of assessment which merits a place in the prognostic study of all types of neoplasia.	D009362
Blood serum peptidases in patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with Ledakrin.	The authors observed changes in activity of leucine amino-peptidase (E.C. 3.4.1.1--LAP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (F.C 2.3.2.2--GGTP) and Co++-activated acylase in blood serum of patients with ovarian carcinoma, with or without ascites, treated with Ledakrin (1-nitro-9-[3-dimethylaminopropylamino] acridine). It was stated that the activities of LAP and GGTP increased during the treatment and during tumor progression. The level of Co++-activated acylase increased only slightly during the treatment and therefore, the determination of this enzyme appeared to be of no use in monitoring the therapy of ovarian carcinoma.

Some new approaches to potential test systems for drugs against prostatic cancer.	We have previously reported on test systems, based on 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-RA) and arginase activities and steroid deposition in animal prostates, potentially useful in screening drugs possibly effective in cancer of the prostate. Recently, we have concentrated on the development of other in vivo and in vitro systems which may prove of further value in testing such drugs. These systems include the following: (a) The effects of drugs on 5alpha-RA activity in human and animal non-malignant and human cancerous prostatic tissues in organ culture. The parameters necessary for the maintenance of optimal 5alpha-RA in such explants have been determined, and it has been shown that certain agents (estramustine phosphate, progesterone, estradiol-17beta) can inhibit 5alpha-RA under in vitro conditions, pointing to the potential use of such an approach in screening various cytostatic agents. In addition, 65Zn deposition, the histology, and the androgen metabolism in such tissues in organ culture are being determined as additional parameters. (b) The deposition of 65Zn in the rat dorsolateral gland, particularly as affected by prolactin and testosterone, and the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on such deposition. Methotrexate and CCNU have been shown to be potent inhibitors of 65Zn deposition in the dorsolateral gland. The parameters related to zinc metabolism in the prostate are being further investigated. (c) The demonstration of receptors for estrogens (estradiol-17beta, diethylstilbestrol) in the prostate of the baboon. The various parameters related to the specificity of such receptors have been established. The development and standardization of these approaches, some facets of which are reported in the present publication, may prove them to be more sensitive, specific, and optimal than other systems and should afford an opportunity to test various combinations of drugs potentially useful in cancer of the prostate with relative speed, efficacy, and ease of manipulation.

Active alkalinization by amphibian gastric fundic mucosa in vitro.	Gastric fundic mucosae in vitro from four species of frog and Necturus secrete HCO-3 at a steady-state rate of 0.25-0.55  microneq-cm-2-h-1 which corresponds to 5-10% of maximal H+ secretion. Net alkalinization was quantitated in mucosae with spontaneously resting H+ secretion or in mucosae inhibited by histamine H2-receptor antagonists or SNC-. HCO-3 secretion was inhibited by DNP (10(-4) M), CN- (10(-2) M), or anoxia. Acetazolamide inhibited alkalinization at 10(-2) M when added to the nutrient side and at 10(-4) M on the luminal side. Carbachol (10(-4) M) and DBcGMP (10(-4) M) stimulated alkalinization and caused a transient rise in the transmucosal PD; DBcAMP (10(-3) M) was without effect. An almost identical secretion occurred spontaneously in antral mucosae and was insensitive to histamine (10(-5) M). Occurrence in both antral and fundic mucosa suggests that active alkalinization is a property of gastric surface epithelial cells. Gastric alkalinization may protect the luminal surface of the mucosa from the damaging effects of acid and contribute to the continuous removal of H+ ions from gastric contents.	D013274
Pituitary and ovarian response to acute stimulation with LH-RH in normal and anovulatory women.	The LH FSH estradiol and progesterone responses to acute stimulation with LH-RH were studied in 12 normal women with ovulatory cycles (4 in the initial follicular phase, 4 in the mid-follicular phase and 4 in the late follicular phase) and in two castrated women, two under hormonal contraception, two with ovarian amenorrhea, twelve with central amenorrhea of no detectable origin (6 with normal and 6 with low basal gonadotrophins), eleven anovulatory patients with pseudomenstruation, two with anorexia nervosa, and two with pituitary amenorrhea. Each woman received a rapid i.v. injection of 100 microgram synthetic LH-RH at 9:00 a.m. Serum levels of LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone were determined by radioimmunoassay in samples collected before and 60, 120, 240 and 480 minutes after injection. The findings were : 1) A significant rise in estradiol and progesterone levels, in addition to LH and FSH elevation, in normal women; 2) A lack of ovarian steroid response in the castrated women and in ovarian amenorrheas, which suggests that the source of steroid response to stimulation is not extragonadal; 3) Significant differences in the responses of the four hormones to LH-RH in the women with central amenorrhea in comparison with the normal group with great variability of results; the steroid response in the presence of a positive LH response might correlate with the severity and/or prognosis of the disorder, a point deserving further study; 4) In anovulatory women with pseudomenstruation, LH responses for the most part normal, and particularly, progesterone responses.

Human thymidylate kinase. Purification, characterization, and kinetic behavior of the thymidylate kinase derived from chronic myelocytic leukemia.	Thymidylate kinase derived from the blast cells of human chronic myelocytic leukemia was purified 2186-fold to near homogeneity by means of alcohol precipitation, alumina-Cgamma gel fractionation, calcium phosphate gel fraction, ultrafiltration, and affinity column chromatography. The molecular weight was estimated by glycerol gradient centrifugation to be 50,000. This enzyme had an optimal activity at pH 7.1 and required a divalent cation in order to catalyze the reaction. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were found to be the preferential divalent cations. The activation energy was estimated to be 19.1 kcal/mol at pH 7.2. Initial velocity study suggested that the reaction followed a sequential mechanism. Mg2+ ATP had a Km of 0.25 mM and dTMP had a Km of 40 micrometer. The enzyme was unstable even at 4 degrees. In the presence of ATP or dTMP the enzyme maintained its activity. Purine triphosphate nucleosides were found to be better phosphate donors than the pyrimidine triphosphate nucleosides. ATP and dATP had a lower Km and a higher Vmax than GTP and dGTP. dTMP was the only preferred phosphate receptor among all the monophosphate nucleotides tested dTTP and IdUTP competed with both substrates and inhibited the reaction with a Ki of 0.75 mM and 1.1 mM, respectively.

Bile lysosomal enzymes: characteristics and pathological significance for various hepatobiliary disorders.	The activities of several glycosidases (beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase) were demonstrated in human bile. The enzyme activities are increased about 100 times after exclusion of bile salts and other small molecular compounds by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. The use of 4-methylumbelliferyl derivatives as substrates was useful as measurement of the bile enzyme activities are not altered in the presence of bile pigments. Enzyme characteristics of bile glycosidases were determined: pH optimum and isoelectric point. The bile glycosidase activities were also measured in various hepatobiliary disorders (cholelithiasis, cancer of gallbladder, acute hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and fatty liver). The glycosidase activities in bile from patients with liver diseases, as well as with cholelithiasis, were generally decreased. Isoelectric focusing patterns of biliary glycosidases were similar for specimens from patients with hepatobiliary disorders as compared to normal.	D005706
Effect of caerulein on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase in the duodenal juice in chronic pancreatitis.	During infusion of caerulein, the output of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and biliary alkaline phosphatase is significantly more increased in chronic pancreatitis patients than in normal subjects. The presence of the gall-bladder is necessary to observe this effect of caerulein. It is not related to the discharge of large amounts of both enzymes by the diseases pancreas.	D010190

This paper describes the most recent development in the field of biosynthesis of L-Asparaginase by means of various culture, purification by Column Chromatography, informations of the Catabolite repression of L-Asparaginase and its metabolism in mycobacteria. The separation, purification studies, idea about the effect of different PH on activity, quaternary structure and the effect of specific antibodies on catalytic activity of L-Asparaginase is discussed. This material shows the role of L-Asparaginase in acute lymphocytic leukemia.	D054198
Evaluation of research on control of prolactin secretion.	At least three substances have been reported to be present in the hypothalamus that can inhibit prolactin release, namely a PIF, catecholamines and acetylcholine. At least four substances have been reported to be present in the hypothalamus that can stimulate prolactin release, namely PRF, TRH, serotonin and prostaglandins. Neither the existence of a distinctive PIF or PRF in the hypothalamus can be considered as definitely established. The predominant action of the mammalian hypothalamus on prolactin release is inhibitory under most conditions, and is stimulatory in avian species. In addition to control by the hypothalamus, several hormones and drugs can act directly on the pituitary to alter prolactin release. The interrelationships of these agents within and without the hypothalamus on prolactin secretion are complex, and there are many questions about their mode of action. Studies on the regulation of prolactin secretion have resulted in development of many methods for either increasing or decreasing release of this important hormone, and thereby have provided opportunities for influencing lactation, growth of mammary and pituitary tumors and other tissues responsive to prolactin.

Value of alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and glutamate dehydrogenase activity measurements (single and combined) in serum in diagnosis of metastasis to the liver.	We assessed, in 98 patients with cancer, the diagnostic value of measuring serum alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and glutamate dehydrogenase activities as an aid to detection of liver metastases. All four enzymes showed diagnostic value, but 5'-nucleotidase appeared to have the greatest. It showed the lowest false-positive results (7.4%) with the highest predictive value of a positive test (85.7%) and agreement (81.3%).. gamma-Glutamyltransferase showed the lowest proportion of false-negative results (2.8%), but was the least specific 35% false-positive results). Analysis of various test combinations showed that the best agreement (77.5%) was obtained when the patients were divided into those who had no or only one abnormal test result, and those who had two or more abnormal test results. However, this was not better than the agreement for 5' nucleotidase alone (81.3%). The agreement of 5'-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (i.e., both tests were positive or negative) was excellent (91.4%), but such agreement included only 67% of the patients with liver metastases.

[Treatment of peptic ulcer in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with histamine H2-receptor antagonists (author's transl)].	Histamine H2-receptor antagonists metiamide and cimetidine were used in the treatment of severe peptic ulceration in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The ulcerations were completely healed in all four patients after treatment lasting from six weeks to four-and-a-half-months. Two patients developed recurrent ulcer after the treatment had stopped, but responded to a second course. One patient developed hepatitis B during cimetidine treatment and it is possible that the course of the hepatitis was unfavourable affected by cimetidine. But no other side effects were noted nor was there a significant change in basal serum-gastrin concentration or an increase in H+ secretion. Total gastrectomy remains the treatment of choice in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, but cimetidine should be considered if the patient refuses operation or operation is not feasible because of a poor general state.

Estimation of serum acid proteases at pH 1.8 and pH 3.5 in patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and gastric carcinoma.	Using a simple hemoglobin method on the basis of Anson-Mirsky's method, acid protease levels in serum were measured at pH 1.8 (pepsin) and pH 3.5 (gastricsin) in 18 healthy controls and 14 patients with duodenal ulcer, 19 patients with gastric ulcer and 18 patients with gastric cancer. Though acid protease activity in pH 1.8 in duodenal ulcer has a tendency to show a little higher level than healthy controls, there is no significant difference in acid protease levels between controls and each of three diseases.

H2-Histamine receptor blocking agents in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Experience in seven cases and implications for long-term therapy.	H2-Histamine receptor blocking agents metiamide and cimetidine were assessed in seven patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (serum gastrin greater than 300 microgram/ml, basal acid output greater than 15 meq/h, ratio of basal acid output to maximal acid output greater than 0.5). Intravenous or oral administration of the drugs lowered acid secretion by at least 70% in all cases. Subsequent treatment of six patients for 3 to 15 months (oral therapy) and one patient for 1 month (intravenous therapy) showed that the drugs abolished symptoms in all seven, abolished diarrhea in five, allowed ulcer healing in six, and were well tolerated without adverse effects in seven. No patient failed to respond to the drug, although one died from tumor progression and two required total gastrectomy for complex reasons. The results indicate that patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can be managed medically and, in light of current mortality trends, gain little from the extra risks attending total gastrectomy.

In vivo release of gastrin into human gastric juice.	The release of antral gastrin has been examined in human subjects by infusing saline and albumin into their stomachs. Immunoreactive gastrin (IRG) was present in fasting serum but not in fasting gastric juice. Intragastric infusions of saline and albumin induced small but significant (P less than 0.05) rises in the serum concentrations of IRG. There was no significant difference between the magnitude of the serum gastrin responses to these two stimuli. The stimuli induced a rise in the luminal concentration of IRG which was sixfold greater than that in the serum concentration of IRG. The response to albumin was significantly greater than the response to saline (P less than 0.05). The IRG in gastric juice was chromatographically similar to heptadecapeptide gastrin. The stimuli also released IRG in patients with duodenal ulcers. The magnitude of the release into serum and gastric juice in these patients was significantly reduced by antrectomy (P less than 0.05).

Arylsulfatases in bilharziasis.	Arylsulfatase A and B in urine have been estimated in 18 normal subjects and 50 bilharziasis patients. The bilharziasis patients were divided into two groups according to the type of infeciton. Those with bilharziasis haematobian type of infection and those with the bilharziasis mansoni type. Each group was further subdivided into subgroups according to the severity and progress of the disease. The activities of arylsulfatase A and B were significantly elevated in all the groups of patients studied and it is evident that there is a progressive increase with the progress of the disease in both types of bilharziasis infections (the haematobian and mansoni types). Liver dysfunction consequent of bilharzial infestation appears to take part in the mechanism of induction of the bilharzial bladder cancer.	D001749
H2-receptor antagonists in perspective.	Cimetidine, like its predecessors burinamide and metiamide, has been shown in vitro to be a specific competitive histamine H2-receptor antagonist. In vivo, it is a potent inhibitor of histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in animals and man after both intravenous and oral administration. Doses sufficient to inhibit gastric secretions are without measureable effects on other physiologic systems. The main indication for cimetidine is in the treatment of duodenal ulcer and of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Useful indications are treatment of gastric ulcer and pnacreatic insufficiency. Possible indications are prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and treatment of peptic esophagitis. The neutrophil toxicity seen with metiamide has so far not been demonstrated with cimetidine; side effects with cimetidine have generally been trivial. In the future, H2-receptor antagonists are likely to become key therapeutic agents in diseases in which gastric acid-pepsin secretion plays a pathogenetic role.	D015043
[Glucide intolerance and its pathogenic mechanisms during parenteral feeding].	Hyperglycaemia during parenteral alimentation occurs either as a result of an error in the supplies provided or as a result of diminished carbohydrate tolerance. The circumstances surrounding the development of carbohydrate intolerance are essentially : severe infections, major catabolic states, renal insufficiency, extensive burns, pancreatic problems and diabetes. From a pathogenic standpoint, there are two dominant elements : disturbances in hepatic gluconeogenesis and changes in insulin secretion and in resistance to insulin. The physiopathology is dominated by the risk of hyperosmolarity. Hypoglycaemia occurs most frequently as the result of a manit fest error : too sudded interruption of carbohydrate supplies or two high dosage of exogenous insulin.	D010190
Relaxin, a male hormone? Immunocytological localization of a related antigen in the boar testis.	Convincingly demonstrated by immunocytological methods in females of several mammalian species, relaxin has not yet been localized in the male. Immunocytologically, a related antigen was identified in adult normal boar testes using and anti- [NIH P-relaxin/HSA] antiserum free of anti HSA Abs. A strong reaction was observed in interstitial cells, a weaker but very clear one in Sertoli cells. NIH P-relaxin and HC1-acetone extracts of either corpora lutea from pregnant sows or boar testes inhibited the immunofluorescence of the reactive structures in the boar testes as well as in ovaries of pregnant sows. Ethanol-acetone precipitates from boar rete testis or caudal epididymal fluids inhibited the reaction of interstitial and Sertoli cells, but this inhibition in the sow was limited only to degenerative ovarian structures, probably due to an insufficient level of inhibiting antigen in these two seminal fluids, in contrast with the very high concentration of relaxin in luteal cells of pregnant sows. Specific immunofluorescence was observed neither in ectopic testes of adult monocryptorchid boars (contrary to scrotal testes in these same animals) nor in testes of prepuberal pigs. The specificity and meaning of these results are discussed.	D010051
Prolactin inhibiting activity of dopamine-free subcellular fractions from rat mediobasal hypothalamus.	In order to check the hypothesis of an identity of dopamine (DA) and prolactin inhibiting activity (PIF), their subcellular distribution was studied in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and the striatum, which served as a control structure. PIF was tested both in vivo and on pituitary incubates. Fractions were also assayed after adsorption of their catecholamine content on alumina, as well as in presence of haloperidol or alpha-flupentixol, potent DA receptor inhibitors. In the MBH, PIF was evenly distributed in the 17,000 g supernatant (S2) and in the crude mitochondrial fraction (P2) which contains synaptosomes. PIF activity was completely removed by alumina adsorption of S2, but not of P2 in spite of an over 99.9% elimination of DA. In contrast, striatal PIF activity was detected only in P2, and disappeared completely upon alumina adsorption, thus indicating that, in this structure, it is entirely due to DA. Addition of haloperidol (10--5M) or alpha-flupentixol (10--6M) reduced PIF activity of crude MBH homogenates, but no longer affected it after alumina adsorption. Quantitative studies suggest that only half of the total MBH PIF activity is accounted for by DA. It is concluded that the MBH contains dopamine-free PIF, which, as already shown for several other neurohormones, is exclusively distributed in nerve-endings.	D001932

Bone marrow transplantation between mixed leukocyte culture reactive siblings.	Bone marrow transplantation from an HLA identical MLC reactive sibling has been performed in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia resistant to drug treatment. Prompt engraftment was documented; however, the patient died of septicemia 34 days after transplant. Clinical manifestation of graft vs. host reaction was mild but was moderately strong expressed at autopsy tissue samples. Recurrence of persistence of leukemia was found at the time of death.	D015470
The isolation and properties of a non-pepsin proteinase from human gastric mucosa.	1. A non-pepsin proteinase, proteinase 2, was successfully isolated free from pepsinogen (by repetitive chromatography on DEAE- and CM-celluloses) from the gastric mucosa of a patient with a duodenal ulcer and the uninvaded mucosa of a patient with a gastric adenocarcinoma. 2. Proteinases 1a and 1b, found in gastric adenocarcinoma, were not found in the gastic mucosa of these patients. 3. Proteinase 2 was shown to have an asymmetrical broad pH-activity curve with a maximum over the pH range 3.0-3.7. 4. Proteolytic activity of proteinase 2 was inhibited by pepstatin; the concentration of pepstatin giving 50% inhibition is of the order of 3nm. 5. Inhibition of proteolytic activity by carbenoxolone and related triterpenoids indicated that at pH 4.0 proteinase 2 possesses structural characteristics relating it to the pepsins and at pH 7.4 to the pepsinogens. 6. The sites of cleavage of the B-chain of oxidized insulin for proteinase 2 at pH 1.7 and pH 3.5 were shown to be similar to those previously established for human pepsin 3 and for the cathepsin E of rabbit bone marrow. 7. The non-pepsin proteinase 2 (cathepsin) of human gastric mucosa has properties more similar to cathepsin E than to the cathepsins D.	D013274
Increased hemoglobin-oxygen affinity in patients with pancreatitis associated with type I and V hyperlipoproteinemia.	Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves were performed from blood of subjects with pancreatitis associated with Type V and Type I hyperlipoproteinemia. The hemoglobin-oxygen affininty was markedly increased with P50 varying from 22.3 to 17.7 mmHg. As the hyperlipoproteinemia subsided the clinical and laboratory signs of pancreatic affection disappeared. The increased hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and decreased flow of red cells due to hyperchylomicronemia in the microcirculation may lead to tissue hypoxia, which may act as a precipitating injurious factor leading to pancreatitis during severe hyperlipemia.

A novel gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in renal carcinoma in comparison with normal kidney enzyme.	A novel gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was found in a renal carcinoma tissue. This enzyme electrophoresed more quickly than that of normal kidney, but more slowly than normal liver enzyme. Their Rf values are 0.46, 0.33, and 0.52 for the renal carcinoma, normal kidney and normal liver enzyme, respectively. After treatment of the renal carcinoma and normal kidney enzyme with neuraminidase, the renal carcinoma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase still electrophoresed slightly faster than that of normal kidney. The catalytic properties of the renal carcinoma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were almost the same as those of normal kidney except for molecular weight; the molecular weight for the renal carcinoma was estimated to be about 130 000, while that of normal kidney was about 90 000. These results may mean that the enzyme of the renal carcinoma is different from that of normal kidney in chemical constituents other than sialic acid. Of 10 patients with renal carcinoma examined electrophoretically, 5 posessed this novel enzyme in their renal carcinoma tissues.	D007680
Prolactin and pituitary tumors.		D001932
The pathophysiology of hyperprolactinemic states and the role of newer ergot compounds in their treatment.	Studies of prolactin secretion in humans have confirmed the concept, derived originally from animal investigations, that prolactin is predominantly controlled by tonic inhibition from the hypothalamus. The locus of action of dopamine and dopaminergic agents such as the ergot alkaloids inhibiting prolactin secretion appears to be primarily at the pituitary level, though a hypothalamic action to increase secretion of prolactin inhibitory factor may also contribute. Prolactin hypersecretion, through any of several possible mechanisms, is frequently but not always found in patients with galactorrhea. Recent studies have shown that hyperprolactinemia is considerably more common than was previously appreciated among patients without galactorrhea. It is present in at least two-thirds of all patients with pituitary tumors and in a significant minority of patients with secondary amenorrhea. Its clinical measurement in these conditions is therefore of considerable diagnostic importance. Whatever the pathophysiology of its production, hyperprolactinemia of all forms is responsive to treatment with the newer ergot alkaloids. The potential use of these agents for therapeutic purposes, particularly in the treatment of infertility, appears to be wider than was originally anticipated.	D001932
Localization of D-amino acid oxidase on the cell surface of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.	The ultrastructural localization of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) was studied cytochemically by detecting sites of hydrogen peroxide production in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Reaction product, which forms when cerous ions react with H2O2 to form an electron-dense precipitate, was demonstrated on the cell surface and within the phagosomes of phagocytically stimulated cells when D-amino acids were provided as substrate. Resting cells showed only slight activity. The competitive inhibitor D,L-2-hydroxybutyrate greatly reduced the D-amino acid-stimulated reaction while KCN did not. The cell surface reaction was abolished by nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzyme activity while that within the phagosome was not eliminated. Dense accumulations of reaction product were formed in cells which phagocytosed Staphylococcus aureus in the absence of exogenous substrate. No reaction product formed with Proteus vulgaris while an intermediate amount formed when Escherichia coli were phagocytosed. Variation in the amount of reaction product with the different bacteria correlated with the levels of D-amino acids in the bacterial cell walls which are available for the DAO of PMNs. An alternative approach utilizing ferricyanide as an electron acceptor was also used. This technique verified the results obtained with the cerium reaction, i.e., the DAO is located in the cell surface and is internalized during phagocytosis and is capable of H2O2 production within the phagosome. The present finding that DAO is localized on the cell surface further supports the concept that the plasma membrane is involved in peroxide formation in PMNs.	D016715
Hypothalamic regulatory hormones: physiological and clinical implications.	The hypothalamic regulatory hormones used for clinical studies are TRH, Gn-RH and somatostatin. In addition, as dopamine appears to be a physiological PIF, the dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine, could be considered as functional analogues of PIF. Gn-RH can be used to study the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal relationship and to test the secretory reserve capacity of the gonadotrophs in disease states. Unfortunately Gn-RH testing discrimulates between pituitary and hypothalamic diseases only poorly. However gonadotrophin deficient men or women may be successfully treated with long-term Gn-RH with induction of puberty, potency, spermatogenesis and ovulation. Somatostatin has multiple actions in inhibiting endocrine and exocrine secretion but its actions are still being explored in diabetes. Bromocriptine, a long acting dopamine agonist (a functional analogue of PIF), suppresses prolactin and is highly effective in treating many hypogonadal states since hyperprolactinaemia is common. It also lowers growth hormone in acromegaly. TRH has provided a major, accurate, sensitive and safe test of thyroid function.	D001932
Lymphocyte ecto-5'-nucleotidase deficiency in agammaglobulinemia.	Fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes from eight patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia demonstrate reduced ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity when compared to the mean activity of normal subjects and patients with other forms of immunoglobulin deficiency. A specific defect of ecto-5'-nucleotidase is further suggested by normal values for lymphocyte ecto-adenosinetriphosphatase and ecto-nonspecific phosphatase. The data provide evidence for an enzyme deficiency in this X-linked, B lymphocyte deficiency syndrome.	D015448
Neuroendocrine disorders in depressions and their significance for the monoamine hypothesis of depression.	This article discusses the results of recent neuroendocrinological research in depressions. The abnormalities found in a given category of vital depressive patients--cortisol hypersecretion, decreased growth hormone response to insulin hypoglycaemia and decreased luteinizing hormone secretion in menopause--are believed to be due to deficient noradrenalin-(NA)-ergic activity in the hypothalmus. Thus explained, they support the so-called MA (monoamine) hypothesis, which postulates that a functional NA deficiency in the brain plays a role in the pathogenesis of certain types of vital depression. Disorders in certain central MA-ergic systems are predictive of disorders in the hormone secretion of the anterior pituitary. Inversely, disorders in the hormone secretion of the anterior pituitary can be indicative of disorders in the MA-ergic transmission in the hypothalamus. Consequently we can expect a convergence of transmitter research and neuroendocrinological research--two lines of research which have so far been largely separated in studies of human individuals.

Separation and analysis of arylsulfatase isoenzymes in body fluids of man.	Soluble arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1) is present in the body fluids of man in the form of two isoenzymes, arylsulfatase A and B, which reportedly are useful biochemical markers for certain types of malignancy. However, rapid assay of the individual isoenzymes is extremely difficult; procedures based on differential inhibition or activation of the isoenzymes in a mixture yield only semiquantitative results. A feature of these isoenzymes is their inhibition by some common anions (notably phosphate) at physiologic concentrations. The isoenzymes can be separated by anion-exchange chromatography, the B isoenzyme being eluted in the void volume and the A isoenzyme and the anionic inhibitors retarded. Lead is used to sequester phosphate, enabling measurement of A in the salt-eluted fraction. Using this technique, we have found significant elevations of B in the sera of patients with colorectal cancer. The potential of rapid, chromatographic separation coupled with continuous monitoring for arylsulfatase activity is discussed.	D007414
The isolation and identification of 2,4-diketones present in human and animal tissues and in urine.	The chemical isolation of 2,3-diketone fraction from hydrolysates of various mammalian tissues has been accomplished by the use of a modified Girard T procedure. This fraction, which constitutes a new lipid class, has been resolved by gas chromatography into a number of homologous 2,4-diketones, ranging in chain length from C13 to C25. After separation by preparative gas chromatography, the following compounds have been unequivocally identified: 2,4-heptadecanedione, 2,4-nonadecanedione, 2,4-heneicosanedione, 2,4-docosanedione, and delta12-2,4-heneicosenedione. The 2,4-diketones appear to exist in tissues in the free state or in labile combination. They are present also in human urine.	D015458

The average dose was 1,2 g a day for 14 to 195 days. The treatment was remarkably effective in 2 cases, but only partial or temporary improvement was noted in 3 other cases. The last 3 patients failed to respond to treatment. The possibility of a rebound phenomenon requires strict clinical and biological supervision.	D015043
Estradiol receptor analysis in human breast cancer tissue by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel.	Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel combined with limited proteolysis is a simple and specific method for quantitation of estradiol receptors in breast cancer tissue. At least eight different samples can be analyzed simultaneously on one gel, and the whole procedure, including sample preparation, takes less than 7 hr. In comparison with sucrose gradient centrifugation, isoelectric focusing is more sensitive, possibly due to the short time (1.5 to 2 hr) needed for the analysis. Furthermore, only one incubation with tritium-labeled estradiol is needed for an analysis, which means that a smaller amount of tumor tissue is needed than for most other methods. This fact allows analysis of the estrogen receptor content in tumor material obtained from fine-needle biopsy.	D001943
ABO-incompatible marrow transplants.	Seventeen patients with aplastic anemia or acute leukemia received transplants from donors who had major ABO incompatibilities. Antibody titers were decreased by plasma and whole blood exchanges prior to marrow infusion. All 17 patients were successfully engrafted, and there was one possible rejection in the patient with the highest pretransplant anti-A IgG titer. Nine of 17 patients are currently alive. A review was carried out of transplants performed in Seattle between HLA-matched siblings with aplastic anemia and leukemia. Two hundred forty-six evaluable patients with ABO-compatible donors were compared with 46 with minor ABO-incompatible donors. There was no effect of minor ABO incompatibility on graft rejection, incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease, or survival.	D015470
Neuroleptic-induced prolactin level elevation and breast cancer: an emerging clinical issue.	This article reviews the evidence that neuroleptics may increase the risk of breast cancer via their effects on prolactin secretion. All available neuroleptics, including reserpine, raise serum prolactin levels. Elevated serum prolactin level increases the incidence of spontaneously occurring mammary tumors in mice, and increases the growth of established carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rats. Caution is necessary in extrapolating this relationship to human mammary tumors because human and rodent tumors differ in some important characteristics, including hormone responsiveness. Serum prolactin levels in women with, or at risk for, breast cancer have generally been normal, and only a minority of human mammary tumors respond to changes in serum prolactin levels. Epidemiologic studies have failed to demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of neuroleptics or reserpine. Thus, although some human mammary tumors are prolactin dependent, the available evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer in women receiving neuroleptics. We conclude that (1) additional epidemiologic studies of the incidence of mammary tumors in women treated with neuroleptics are desirable; (2) it is premature to mandate warning patients of an unknown and undemonstrated increase in the risk of developing breast cancer associated with neuroleptic treatment; (3) detection of existing mammary tumors by breast examination prior to administration of neuroleptics is desirable; and (4) development of antipsychotic drugs that do not increase serum prolactin level may be indicated.

Neuroendocrine control of prolactin in experimental animals.	Hypothalamic regulation of prolactin secretion in animals (mammals) and man appears to be similar, and no significant differences have yet been demonstrated. The hypothalamus contains neurotransmitters and polypeptides that can either inhibit or stimulate prolactin release, although the predominant influence under basal conditions is to inhibit prolactin release. Thus pituitary stalk section or placement of lesions in the basal tuberal region of the hypothalamus results in increased prolactin release and sometimes in initiation of lactation. Among agents in the hypothalamus that can inhibit prolactin release, the most important appear to be an as yet unidentified polypeptide prolactin release inhibiting factor (PIF) and dopamine. There is some evidence that dopamine may account for most, if not all, of the prolactin release inhibiting activity of the hypothalamus. Agents that increase dopamine activity, i.e. L-dopa, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, etc., depress prolactin release. Acetylcholine also can inhibit prolactin release, but it appears to act via the catecholamines. Of the agents in the hypothalamus that stimulate prolactin release, the most important appear to be an as yet uncharacterized polypeptide prolactin releasing factor (PRF), thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and serotonin. TRH is as effective in releasing prolactin as in releasing TSH, but under most physiological states, TSH and prolactin release do not occur together. Serotonin and its precursors, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan, are powerful releasors of prolactin and have been shown to be involved in some physiological states in which prolactin is released, i.e. during suckling, stress, etc. Other agents in the hypothalamus that can stimulate prolactin release include GABA and some prostaglandins, but these have not yet been shown to be involved in physiological control of prolactin secretion. Exteroceptive stimuli that alter prolactin release act through the CNS and hypothalamus, but some hormones and drugs also can act directly on the pituitary to promote or depress prolactin release.

Secretion pattern of secretin in man: regulation by gastric acid.	Median concentration of plasma secretin in the fasting state in 11 achlorhydria patients, 17 normal subjects, eight duodenal ulcer patients, and 11 Zollinger-Ellison patients was 0.3, 1.2, 2.5, and 5.9 pmol x 1(-1), respectively. Aspiration of gastric acid normal subjects and duodenal ulcer patients was followed by a significant lowering of the plasma secretin concentration. In normal subjects insulin-induced hypoglycaemia resulted in increased secretin levels when gastric acid was allowed to enter the duodenum, whereas no changes were observed when gastric acid was aspirated. Simultaneous measurements of intraduodenal pH and plasma secretin concentration in the fasting state and in response to a meal showed that rapid falls in intraduodenal pH were followed by short-lived increments in plasma secretin concentration. These changes in pH and in secretin levels were diminished after cimetidine. It is concluded that gastric acid in man does trigger release of secretin and that secretin is secreted intermittently both in the fasting state and in response to a meal when boluses of acid enter the duodenum.
